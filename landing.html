        <p>The DJs main aim is to engage and entertain their audience. They do that by selecting tracks
            they think will fit the mood of the crowd. They also account for the situation (is a festival,
            club or bar, are people dancing or sitting down, etc).
            The aim is to keep the music flow going and the crowd dancing for their entire set (usually 1-
            2 hours). They do this by mixing tracks together to create a seemingly endless blend.</p>

        <p>Buying an equipment alone does not make one a DJ, in order to make a music mix as
            seamless as possible, a DJ has a lot of finer control over different elements of the music. This
            is why the mixers and controllers in front of a DJ have so many buttons, knobs, and sliders on
            them. This control everything from effects, to being able to control the volume on certain
            parts of the track. The ability to manipulate parts of the track like this is what allows a DJ to
            seamlessly mix from one track to the other so that, to the crowd, it sounds like a never-ending
            stream of music.</p>

        <p>There are several types of DJ setups you can choose from when first starting out. Some are
            streamlined and require less equipment than others. For the smallest possible setup, you can
            get started with just a laptop and the right software. Other simple options include using only
            two turntables (vinyl or CD) and a mixer.
            You can upgrade either of those setups by adding a laptop with a DJ interface package for
            additional effects and options. For even greater flexibility, consider adding a DJ controller to
            your kit for built-in turntables, sliders, pads, and other controls. If you plan to work from
            MP3s rather than CDs or vinyl, you can get away with a small kit that features a laptop, a
            controller, an audio interface, and software.</p>
