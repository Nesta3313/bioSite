        <p id="about_text">Dele Olaniyan is a resident of Memphis Tennessee and is married with three children.
            Originally from Nigeria, Dele who currently works as a Database Administrator began
            developing interest in music at an early age. While attending birthday parties and weddings,
            he will always find himself near the DJ booth watching with pure amazement at how the DJ
            was able to control the mood and atmosphere of these events. Now in his 40’s, Dele said he
            has always loved the energy of a party that is pumping and wanted to do that and create that
            sort of feeling for people. He decided to act on his passion for DJ-ing during the pandemic in
            2020, since he was forced to work from home and had more time to do something different,
            after purchasing equipment, he watched YouTube tutorials and got advice from DJs he knew.
            When asked how easy song selections were for him, he said “I listen to a lot of music
            especially party/club music, so I already had a pretty good idea of song selection.”
            Dele believes he can pursue a part time career as a professional DJ, after several months of
            practice and learning, in December 2021, he got the big opportunity to perform at a club
            where his friend was a resident and the crowd responded positively to his set. Since then, he
            has performed in little birthday gigs and weddings. His goal is to become good enough to be
            a resident DJ in one of the popular bars in downtown Memphis.</p>
